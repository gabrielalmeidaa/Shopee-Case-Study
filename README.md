## Welcome to the Sales Management App

Hello! This is a Sales Management App, developed as a Case Study for Shopee. 
In this program, users can input, via terminal, sales performed by one of the 5 allowed sellers 
and visualize a list of all sales ranked by sellers with the highest to lowest amount sold.

**Very Important**: The defined allowed seller's names (mostly randomly generated) are:
`
['Tammy Reed', 'Kathryn Curry', 'Wanda Vazquez', 'Fulano', 'Teste']
